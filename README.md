# crawler

Export the project to a runnable jar or use the provided jar directly.

Only one argument is needed to run it : the starting url.

This is a very simple crawler that can be much enhanced, for example:
- add crawling depth 
- add more output format
- hide/show external link
- hide/show static content
- add option to crawl external links
